Group 6's Final Project requirement for UC Berkeley Ext Data Analytics Bootcamp

# Data Collection
All data was collected by using Zillow.com with the help of ZillowDataExporter, a google plug-in that allows users to extract up to 40 line items at a time.
We used the premium feature to extract 800 entries at a time. No dataset exceeded the 800 data entries. Data was exported as Excel (xlsx.) files.
Data was acquired for the following metropolitan cities: Chandler - Arizona, Chicago - Illinois, Los Angeles - California, Miami - Florida, New York - New York, and Portland - Oregon
We wanted to encompass every part of the United States by selecting a city for the West, East, South and Mid-Western regions of the United States. Overall the following 18 exports were obtained.
We consolidated the For Sale, For Rent and Sold properties for all locations into combined files.
